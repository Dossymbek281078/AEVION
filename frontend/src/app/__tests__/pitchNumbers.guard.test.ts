/**
 * Regression guard for retired pitch numbers.
 *
 * Why this exists: the same headline figure ($2B+ ARR, the "Seed $5M" ask, …)
 * used to live as a hardcoded string in ~10 different files with slightly
 * different wording. A cleanup in one window only ever caught the variants
 * someone grepped for, so a stale copy always resurfaced in another surface
 * (SEO meta, OG images, print pages). This test fails the build the moment a
 * retired figure reappears on any pitch surface — so drift is caught in CI,
 * not by a human reading the page months later.
 *
 * Scope is deliberately narrow: only investor-facing pitch surfaces, and only
 * figures that were explicitly retired. Legitimate numbers the founder keeps
 * (valuation ranges like "$1.0-1.6B", the "$10M returnable advance", real
 * plant-cost answers in the smeta trainer) are intentionally NOT matched.
