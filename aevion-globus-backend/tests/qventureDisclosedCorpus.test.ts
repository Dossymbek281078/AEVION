/**
 * The gate for the disclosed-figures corpus.
 *
 * Every figure in `scripts/qventure-disclosed.ts` is one a real company put in a
 * real public document. Six of them were silently unreadable when the corpus was
 * first run — a negative gross margin, a net dollar expansion rate, a membership
 * count, a reservation book, units delivered — and each miss meant the engine
 * scored a filed disclosure as "nothing disclosed" and fell back to the sector
 * average. That is the failure mode this module keeps rediscovering: not a
 * crash, a quiet substitution of the sector prior for the company's own number.
 *
 * These tests pin the readers so a future rubric edit cannot re-break them
 * without CI saying so.
